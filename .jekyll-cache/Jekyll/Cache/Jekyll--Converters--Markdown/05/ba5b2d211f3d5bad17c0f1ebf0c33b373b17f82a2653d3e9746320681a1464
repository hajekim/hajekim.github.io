Syntax highlighting is a feature that displays source code, in different colors and fonts according to the category of terms. This feature facilitates writing in a structured language such as a programming language or a markup language as both structures and syntax errors are visually distinct. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting">Highlighting</a> does not affect the meaning of the text itself; it is intended only for human readers.</p>
